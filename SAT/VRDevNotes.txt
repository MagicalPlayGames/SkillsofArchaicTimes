How to Enable VR in UNITY:



CODE:

//Pointers show where the player is aimed
//This one is in a curve
VRTK>Prefabs>Pointers>ObjectPointerCurved
	Follow Sources - controllers
OVRInputTouchAction - can see input of controllers
	Activation Action - TouchAction active
VRTK event system
	Can use arrow by putting in valid container

//Teleportation movements
VRTK>Prefabs>Locomotion>Teleporters>Teleporter.Instant
								   > Teleporter.Dash								   
	Target = Player
	Offset = HeadsetAllias
	camera validty = scene camera
	target validty = use OVRInputTouchAction
	
//Limit Teleportation
Teleporter.Instant and Curve
Target validity = AnyLayer Rule added to Teleporter.Instant

//ALWAYS LOOK FOR LIBRARIES THAT HAVE REQUIREMENTS
//Use VRTK Docs
//Input for Thumbsticks
OVRInputAxis2DAction


HANDS:
//Hands already in VRTK?
With Hand Script and OVR Grabber
Needs to be in ignore ray cast collision layer
//  can make own OVR Grabber

//Grabbing4Hands
Interactor Prefab onto controller alias
!!!!in grab action, on interactor, insert new touch action

//Grabbing4Interactions
//Used to be able to pass between hands
Interactable.Primary_Grab.Secondary_Swap
!The problem will be to make things good grab looking!

//Throwing
OVRAnchorVelocityEsitmator
Put on controlers and head
and tracking space

//Better Physics grab interactions
//Interactable.GrabAction.FollowAction
set Follow Tracking to Follow RigidBody
and change timestep for physics VV
Edit>Project Settings>Time>Fixed Timestep

***OBJ through hand, hide hand, or custom hand animations***
***Can get objects stuck and unstuckable if the player is "too weak"***
